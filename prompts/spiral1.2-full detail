This document provides a detailed screen-by-screen overview of the Swifties.io mobile browser app, focusing on UI/UX elements, animations, transitions, and differences between logged-in and logged-out user views.

## General UI/UX Considerations:
- **Consistent Branding**: Maintain a consistent visual style throughout the app, including color palettes, typography, and iconography, reflecting the Taylor Swift brand.
- **Mobile-First Design**: All screens should be optimized for mobile devices, ensuring a responsive and intuitive experience on various screen sizes and orientations.
- **Touch-Friendly Interactions**: Design interactions with touch gestures in mind, prioritizing ease of use and clear feedback.
- **Performance**: Optimize all UI elements and animations for smooth performance on mobile browsers.
- **Accessibility**: Ensure the app is accessible to users with disabilities, following WCAG guidelines.

## Screen 1: Homepage (General Discography)

### For Logged-Out Users:

- Tagline (Optional): A short, catchy phrase related to Taylor Swift and the app's purpose.
- Information Icon ("i"): A subtle icon that, when tapped, displays a tooltip or overlay explaining the sunburst diagrams and their interactivity.

**Body**:
- Three distinct, interactive sunburst visualizations of Taylor Swift's discography, presented one at a time.

**Sunburst Visuals**:
- Visually appealing, using color-coding to represent different aspects of the discography (e.g., eras, album release years).

- Smooth transitions between layers and views.

**Sunburst Interaction**:

- Single Tap: Tapping a node (album or song) displays a tooltip/overlay with relevant information (e.g., album title, release date, tracklist).
- Double Tap: Tapping a node (album or era) expands that section, revealing the next layer of the sunburst.
- Pinch to Zoom: Users can zoom in and out on the sunburst to explore details.
- Zoom Out Animation: Swiping left zooms out, collapsing layers until the full discography view is shown.

**Footer**: Fixed footer navigation bar (Music, Profile, Settings, About/Contact).

**Call to Actions (Above Footer)**:
