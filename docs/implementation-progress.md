## Overview
This document tracks the implementation progress of the Swifties.io music ranking application. It provides a summary of completed features, current work, and planned future development.

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Skeleton UI (COMPLETED)
- ✅ Basic application structure with Vue 3 and Vue Router
- ✅ Fixed header and footer positioning
- ✅ Placeholder components for all major views
- ✅ Navigation between screens
- ✅ Mobile-first responsive design
- ✅ Basic styling with Tailwind CSS

### Phase 2: UI Enhancement (COMPLETED)
- ✅ Improved user experience for non-logged-in users
- ✅ Enhanced visual elements with gradients, badges, and icons
- ✅ Login/logout simulation
- ✅ Toast notification system
- ✅ Improved navigation flow between views
- ✅ Clear visual cues and explanatory text

### Phase 3: Album Drag-and-Drop UI (COMPLETED)
- ✅ Static album data with placeholder images
- ✅ Pinia state management for album rankings
- ✅ Drag-and-drop functionality with vuedraggable
- ✅ Tier capacity enforcement (1/2/3/3/2 albums per tier)
- ✅ Mobile touch optimization
- ✅ Local storage persistence for rankings
- ✅ Visual feedback for drag operations

### Phase 4: Basic Sunburst Display (COMPLETED)
- ✅ Integration with existing SunburstChart component
- ✅ Three visualization types:
  - ✅ Overview (by tier)
  - ✅ Era-based grouping
  - ✅ Time period grouping
- ✅ Reactive updates based on ranking changes
- ✅ Empty state handling
- ✅ Improved dashboard layout

### Phase 5: Song Ranking (PENDING)
- ⬜ Static song data structure
- ⬜ Song ranking interface
- ⬜ Album context for songs
- ⬜ Song visualization in dashboard

### Phase 6: API Integration (PENDING)
- ⬜ Connect to backend API
- ⬜ User authentication
- ⬜ Saving rankings to database
- ⬜ Loading rankings from database
- ⬜ Profile management

## Technical Implementation Details

### State Management
The application uses Pinia for state management with the following stores:
- **userStore**: Manages user authentication and profile data
- **rankingStore**: Handles album and song rankings

### Data Persistence
- Rankings are currently stored in localStorage for persistence between sessions
- The rankingStore includes methods to convert the tiered ranking structure to a flat format suitable for API storage

### Component Structure
- **Views**: Main page components (Home, Dashboard, AlbumRanking, etc.)
- **Components**: Reusable UI elements
- **Services**: Utility services like toast notifications

### Mobile Optimization
- Touch-specific handling for drag-and-drop operations
- Responsive design for all screen sizes
- Collapsible album shelf for better space utilization on mobile

## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge: Drag-and-Drop on Mobile
**Solution**: Implemented touch-specific options in the drag-and-drop configuration, including touch thresholds and fallback mode for better mobile experience.

### Challenge: Tier Capacity Limits
**Solution**: Created a checkMove function that validates moves based on tier capacity limits, preventing users from adding more albums than allowed in each tier.

### Challenge: Visualization Performance
**Solution**: Used computed properties with key binding to ensure efficient updates to the sunburst visualization when rankings change.

### Challenge: Data Persistence
**Solution**: Implemented localStorage backup with automatic saving when rankings change, ensuring user work is not lost between sessions.

## Next Steps

1. Implement song ranking functionality following a similar pattern to album ranking
2. Connect the local rankings to the backend API when it's ready
3. Add performance optimizations like debouncing for frequent updates
4. Enhance user experience with animations and more detailed information displays
5. Implement social features like sharing and comparing rankings

## Testing Guidelines

When testing the application, focus on these key areas:
1. Drag-and-drop functionality and tier capacity limits
2. Persistence of rankings across page refreshes
3. Visualization updates when rankings change
4. Mobile responsiveness and touch interactions

## Conclusion
Phases 1-4 have been successfully completed, establishing a solid foundation for the Swifties.io application. The core functionality of album ranking and visualization is now working, with a focus on user experience and mobile compatibility. The next phases will build on this foundation to add song ranking capabilities and backend integration.
