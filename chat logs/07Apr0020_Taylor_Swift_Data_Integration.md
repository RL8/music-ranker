# Taylor Swift Data Integration and Supabase Implementation

**Date:** April 7, 2025  
**Time:** 00:20  

## Major Themes Discussed

1. **Taylor Swift Data Analysis**
   - Analyzed songs appearing on multiple albums
   - Identified popular songs that appear across different albums
   - Determined that 38.37% of songs appear on multiple albums

2. **Database Schema Design**
   - Designed an improved schema to handle songs appearing on multiple albums
   - Created a junction table approach for song-album relationships
   - Added support for different song versions (live, acoustic, etc.)

3. **Supabase Integration**
   - Created SQL scripts for table creation
   - Developed migration scripts for data import
   - Attempted API-based implementation
   - Identified limitations with direct API schema changes

4. **Sunburst Visualization**
   - Updated the SunburstDemo component to use Supabase data
   - Added support for filtering by era
   - Implemented toggle for local vs. Supabase data sources

## Features Implemented

1. **Improved Database Schema**
   - `taylor_swift_albums` table for album information
   - `taylor_swift_songs` table for unique songs
   - `taylor_swift_song_appearances` junction table for song-album relationships
   - `taylor_swift_song_ratings` table for user ratings

2. **Data Analysis Scripts**
   - Created scripts to analyze songs appearing on multiple albums
   - Implemented detailed reporting on song duplication
   - Added categorization of song versions

3. **Supabase Service**
   - Developed comprehensive service for interacting with Taylor Swift data
   - Added methods for querying by album, era, and other criteria
   - Implemented support for the new junction table approach

4. **Sunburst Visualization Enhancements**
   - Added era-based filtering
   - Implemented Supabase data source toggle
   - Enhanced error handling for data loading

## Technical Details

1. **Database Schema**
   - Used UUIDs for primary keys
   - Implemented foreign key relationships for data integrity
   - Added appropriate indexes for query performance
   - Created helper functions for common queries

2. **Junction Table Approach**
   - Each unique song exists once in the database
   - Song appearances on albums are tracked in a separate table
   - Added version information (studio, live, acoustic, etc.)
   - Preserved track positions and disc numbers

3. **SQL Implementation**
   - Split SQL implementation into manageable chunks
   - Created scripts for tables, indexes, RLS policies, and functions
   - Added row-level security for proper access control

4. **Environment Configuration**
   - Updated environment variables for Supabase integration
   - Added service role key support for administrative operations

## Next Steps

1. **Supabase Reboot**
   - Remove existing Supabase integration
   - Implement fresh integration with improved approach
   - Ensure proper authentication and authorization

2. **Schema Implementation**
   - Execute SQL scripts in Supabase dashboard
   - Run migration script to populate data
   - Verify data integrity and relationships

3. **UI Integration**
   - Connect UI components to new Supabase schema
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Add loading states for asynchronous operations

4. **User Features**
   - Implement song rating functionality
   - Add filtering by version type
   - Create admin interface for data management

## Documentation Updates

1. **SQL Scripts**
   - Created documentation for SQL scripts
   - Added comments explaining table relationships
   - Documented helper functions

2. **Migration Process**
   - Documented the data migration process
   - Added error handling and validation
   - Created detailed logs for troubleshooting

3. **Service Methods**
   - Documented Supabase service methods
   - Added examples for common operations
   - Created type definitions for data structures

## Challenges and Solutions

1. **API Limitations**
   - Identified limitations with direct API schema changes
   - Created alternative approaches using SQL Editor
   - Documented process for future reference

2. **Data Duplication**
   - Solved the problem of songs appearing on multiple albums
   - Implemented junction table approach
   - Added version tracking for different appearances

3. **Authentication**
   - Added service role key support for administrative operations
   - Implemented proper row-level security
   - Ensured secure access to sensitive operations
