# Album Song Data Consolidation

## Major Themes Discussed
- Issue with songs not loading for albums in the Music Ranker application
- Inconsistent data sources for album and song information
- Need for a unified approach to loading album data across the application

## Features Implemented
1. Added comprehensive song lists to all 11 Taylor Swift albums in the static-albums.json file
2. Updated all views to consistently use the static-albums.json file as the single source of truth for album data
3. Refactored the initializeWithSampleData method to use the static-albums.json file for consistency

## Technical Details
- **Root Cause**: The application had multiple sources of album data:
  - static-albums.json file (which initially lacked song data for most albums)
  - Hardcoded album data in various view components
  - Sample data in the rankingStore's initializeWithSampleData method
  
- **Solution Approach**:
  1. Added complete song lists to all albums in static-albums.json
  2. Modified all views to import and use static-albums.json
  3. Updated the rankingStore.initializeWithSampleData method to use static-albums.json

- **Files Modified**:
  - src/data/static-albums.json
  - src/views/AlbumRankingCoverflowView.vue
  - src/views/SongRankingCarouselView.vue
  - src/views/SongRankingView.vue
  - src/store/rankingStore.js

## Next Steps
1. Consider adding additional album metadata like release dates, producers, etc.
2. Implement proper error handling for cases where static-albums.json might be missing or corrupted
3. Add unit tests to verify proper album and song loading
4. Consider implementing a backend API to serve album and song data instead of relying on static JSON files

## Documentation Updates
- The application now uses a consistent approach for loading album and song data
- All album data is centralized in the static-albums.json file
- No code changes are needed to add or modify album or song information - just update the static-albums.json file

## Additional Information
- The solution prioritizes simplicity and maintainability over complex data relationships
- By keeping songs directly with their album data, we ensure they'll always be available when the album is loaded
- This approach eliminates the need for complex matching logic between separate data files
